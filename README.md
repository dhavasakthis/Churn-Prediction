# Churn-Prediction
Developed a churn prediction model using SVC with data preprocessing and class imbalance techniques.

Bank Churn Prediction Project

Utilized the Bank Churn Modelling dataset to predict customer churn using machine learning.
Preprocessed data through feature encoding, handling missing values, and creating new features (e.g., "zero balance").
Employed resampling techniques such as under-sampling and over-sampling to handle class imbalance.
Built and evaluated models using Support Vector Classifier (SVC), achieving results through accuracy scores, confusion matrices, and classification reports.
Applied hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV to optimize model performance, improving prediction accuracy.
Implemented data scaling techniques on relevant features for model training and testing.
